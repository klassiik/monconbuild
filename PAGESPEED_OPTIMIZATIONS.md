# PageSpeed Optimization - Monument Construction Website

## Performance Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ PostHog Analytics Removed
**Issue:** PostHog scripts were adding 31 KiB of legacy JavaScript and causing:
- Long main-thread tasks (185ms)
- Forced reflows (55ms)
- Render-blocking requests

**Fix:** Commented out all PostHog tracking code in `public/index.html`
- **Savings:** ~610ms render time + 31 KiB JavaScript

### 2. ✅ Image Lazy Loading Added
**Issue:** Images loading immediately, blocking LCP (7.0s)

**Fix:** Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to all images:
- Portfolio images
- About page image
- Homepage images

**Expected Improvement:** Faster LCP and reduced initial payload

### 3. ✅ Sitemap & Robots.txt Fixed
**Issue:** 35 errors in robots.txt

**Fix:** 
- Created proper `sitemap.xml` with all 6 pages
- Created valid `robots.txt` pointing to sitemap
- All pages properly indexed for SEO

### 4. ✅ Button Accessibility Fixed
**Issue:** Buttons without accessible names

**Fix:** Added `aria-label` attributes to:
- All phone call buttons
- Logo link in header
- Navigation elements

**Result:** Better screen reader support and accessibility score

### 5. ✅ DNS Prefetch Added
**Issue:** External image loading from emergentagent.com causing delays

**Fix:** Added to `<head>`:
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://customer-assets.emergentagent.com" crossorigin />
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://customer-assets.emergentagent.com" />
```

**Expected Improvement:** Faster external resource loading

## Remaining Optimizations (For Production)

### Image Optimization (Biggest Impact - 4,475 KiB savings)

**Current Issue:** All images hosted on emergentagent.com are unoptimized JPG/PNG

**Recommended Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Use Next-Gen Formats (Recommended)
Convert images to WebP or AVIF:
```bash
# Convert to WebP (better browser support)
cwebp -q 80 input.jpg -o output.webp

# Or use online tool: https://squoosh.app
```

**Expected Result:** 60-80% smaller file sizes

#### Option 2: Self-Host Optimized Images
1. Download all project images
2. Resize to actual display dimensions (max 1920px width)
3. Compress using tools like:
   - TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com)
   - Squoosh (https://squoosh.app)
4. Upload to `/public/images/` folder
5. Update image URLs in components

**Expected Result:** 70-80% reduction in image size

#### Option 3: Use Image CDN
Consider using:
- Cloudinary (free tier)
- ImageKit (free tier)
- Vercel Image Optimization (built-in)

**Implementation:** Update image URLs to use CDN with automatic optimization

## Expected PageSpeed Score Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- **Mobile Performance:** 66/100
- **LCP:** 7.0s
- **Total Blocking Time:** 200ms
- **Speed Index:** 4.7s

### After Current Fixes (Estimated):
- **Mobile Performance:** 75-80/100
- **LCP:** 5.0-5.5s (improved by removing PostHog)
- **Total Blocking Time:** 50-100ms
- **Speed Index:** 3.5-4.0s

### After Image Optimization (Estimated):
- **Mobile Performance:** 85-92/100
- **LCP:** 2.5-3.5s
- **Total Blocking Time:** 50ms
- **Speed Index:** 2.5-3.0s

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Remove Unused CSS
The main CSS file (11 KB) likely contains unused Tailwind classes.

**Fix:** Enable PurgeCSS in production (should be automatic with Tailwind)

### 2. Enable Compression
Ensure Vercel is serving files with Gzip/Brotli compression (should be automatic)

### 3. Add Cache Headers
Vercel automatically adds proper cache headers for static assets, but verify:
- CSS/JS: 1 year cache
- Images: 1 year cache
- HTML: No cache (for updates)

### 4. Monitor Performance
After deployment, retest with:
- PageSpeed Insights: https://pagespeed.web.dev
- WebPageTest: https://www.webpagetest.org
- Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)

## How to Optimize Images (Quick Guide)

### Step 1: Download Current Images
```bash
curl -o image1.jpg "https://customer-assets.emergentagent.com/job_99d86ab4-e27f-41c7-9c4d-305324a0277f/artifacts/6s7jphb3_Untitled.jpg"
# ... repeat for all images
```

### Step 2: Compress Images
Use https://squoosh.app:
1. Upload image
2. Select WebP format
3. Set quality to 80
4. Download optimized image

### Step 3: Replace in Code
```jsx
// Before
<img src="https://customer-assets.emergentagent.com/..." />

// After
<img src="/images/project1.webp" />
```

### Step 4: Add Fallback for Older Browsers
```jsx
<picture>
  <source srcset="/images/project1.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="/images/project1.jpg" alt="..." loading="lazy" />
</picture>
```

## Summary

Current optimizations will improve performance by ~15-20 points. To reach 90+ score, image optimization is **critical** (will save 4.5 MB and improve LCP by 3-4 seconds).

**Recommend:** Optimize images before next deployment for maximum impact.
