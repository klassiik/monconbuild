# Page Title Optimization - Google Search Guidelines

## Overview
Optimized all 12 page titles to meet Google's recommended length of 50-60 characters. This prevents title truncation in search results, ensuring all titles display completely and improving click-through rates.

## Google's Title Tag Recommendations
According to Google Search Central:
- **Ideal length**: 50-60 characters
- **Pixel width**: Maximum 600 pixels (typically ~50-60 characters)
- **Why this matters**: Longer titles get truncated with "..." in search results
- **Impact**: Truncated titles reduce clarity and can hurt CTR (click-through rates)
- **Reference**: [Google's Search Central - Titles](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/titles-meta-descriptions)
