    question: "What's the difference between rough carpentry and finish carpentry?",
    answer: "Rough carpentry involves the structural framework (studs, joists, rafters), while finish carpentry is the visible, decorative woodwork you see every day - trim, molding, doors, built-ins, and cabinetry. Finish carpentry requires precision and attention to detail, as every joint and seam is visible. At Monument Construction, we specialize in high-end finish carpentry throughout Placer and Nevada Counties."

    question: "Do I need a licensed contractor for finish carpentry in California?",
    answer: "Yes! In California, any finish carpentry project over $500 requires a licensed contractor.

Hiring an unlicensed contractor puts you at risk and may void your homeowner's insurance."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of wood are best for trim and molding in the Sierra Nevada climate?",
    answer: "For Placer County's climate with temperature variations and dry summers, we typically recommend MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) or poplar for painted trim - they're stable and resist warping. For stained work, oak, maple, or pine work well. For exterior trim in mountain areas like Truckee, we use cedar or composite materials that resist moisture and temperature changes. We'll recommend the best materials for your specific project and location."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match existing trim in an older home?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We specialize in historic home remodeling in Colfax and surrounding areas. We can match existing profiles by either custom-milling trim to match or sourcing period-appropriate moldings.
