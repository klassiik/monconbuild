# Meta Description Optimization - SEO Best Practices Implementation

## Overview
Optimized all 12 pages on the Monument Construction website to meet Google's recommended meta description length of 110-160 characters. This ensures search result snippets display properly without truncation.

## Issue Addressed
- **Problem**: Meta descriptions were either missing or excessive (200+ characters), causing Google to truncate them in search results
- **Solution**: Implemented Google-recommended 110-160 character meta descriptions on all pages
- **Impact**: Improved search snippet appearance and likelihood of click-through from search results

## Google's Recommendations
According to Google's guidelines:
- **Ideal length**: 110-160 characters
- **Why this matters**: Google often uses the meta description tag to generate search result snippets
- **Benefit**: Prevents truncation and ensures key information is visible to searchers
