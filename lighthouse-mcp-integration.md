# Lighthouse MCP Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide shows how to integrate Lighthouse MCP (Model Context Protocol) into your React application for automated web performance monitoring, analysis, and optimization.

## What is Lighthouse MCP?
Lighthouse MCP is a bridge between Google's Lighthouse performance auditing tool and AI assistants, enabling:
- Automated performance audits
- AI-powered optimization suggestions
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Intelligent performance issue detection and fixes

## Key Benefits
- **Automated Performance Monitoring**: Regular audits without manual intervention
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Smart analysis of performance bottlenecks
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific code changes and optimizations
- **Continuous Integration**: Seamless CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Multi-metric Analysis**: Performance, SEO, Accessibility, Best Practices

## Performance Metrics Tracked
1. **Core Web Vitals**
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - First Input Delay (FID)
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

2. **Loading Performance**
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Speed Index
   - Total Blocking Time (TBT)

3. **SEO & Accessibility**
   - Meta tags optimization
   - Image alt text
   - ARIA labels
   - Color contrast ratios

4. **Best Practices**
   - HTTPS usage
   - Image optimization
   - JavaScript bundling
   - Caching strategies

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Install Required Dependencies
```bash
# Core Lighthouse MCP packages
npm install lighthouse @lighthouse-mcp/core @lighthouse-mcp/cli

# Additional performance monitoring tools
npm install web-vitals workbox-webpack-plugin

# Development dependencies
npm install --save-dev lighthouse-ci @lighthouse-mcp/webpack-plugin
```

### 2. Configure Lighthouse CI
Create `.lighthouserc.js` configuration file for automated audits.

### 3. Set Up Performance Monitoring
Integrate Web Vitals tracking in your React app.

### 4. Create Automated Workflows
Set up GitHub Actions for continuous performance monitoring.

### 5. Configure MCP Server
Set up the MCP server for AI-assisted optimization.

## Current Project Optimizations
Your project already includes several performance optimizations:
- ✅ Static site generation with `react-snap`
- ✅ Tailwind CSS for optimized styling
- ✅ Caching headers in Vercel config
- ✅ Code splitting with React Router
- ✅ Radix UI components (lightweight)

## Next Steps
1. Install Lighthouse MCP dependencies
2. Configure performance monitoring
3. Set up automated audits
4. Implement AI-assisted optimizations
5. Monitor and iterate
